# CS416Projects

In this narrative visualization project, I am conveying the constant increase in minimum wage (both national and state) along with the rise in CPI from 1968 to 2020. To do this, I implemented an interactive slideshow structure so that the user can, at some points, hover over data points to view more information or click on textboxes to see more details about a topic. The slideshow is also restricted to allow the user to only go a page forward or backward, with the exception of the home screen, where the user can choose what slide to navigate to.

Three visual structures are used throughout the slideshow. A barchart shows the national minimum wage through the years, a scatterplot shows the state minimum wages by year, and another scatterplot is used to show the relationship between CPI and year. At the bottom of each scene are previous and next buttons that allow the user to navigate smoothly through the slides. The first slide also outlines what will be covered in the slideshow so as to let the user know what to expect. The scenes are ordered so that an overview is provided, followed by national data, before going into detail about the minimum wage for each state individually. The last slide 

Annotations. What template was followed for the annotations, and why that template? How are the annotations used to support the messaging? Do the annotations change within a single scene, and if so, how and why

Parameters. What are the parameters of the narrative visualization? What are the states of the narrative visualization? How are the parameters used to define the state and each scene?

Triggers. What are the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative visualization? What affordances are provided to the user to communicate to them what options are available to them in the narrative visualization?
